Both wooden instruments are masterpieces of their makers art & the musicians are perfect matches for their instruments.   An all round sublime experience.  Thank you.",

        "comment": "For some context of this piece of music: originally the aria movement from Bach's orchestral suite no. 3 in D major, thus it's in the key of D major. It wasn't until the 19th century virtuoso violinists decided to transcribe the whole movement into key of G so it can be played entirely on the lowest string of the violin to showcase both the violin's improvement and the high position needed to play the whole thing on 1 string. The name thus stuck and we now commonly refer to this movement as air on the g string",
